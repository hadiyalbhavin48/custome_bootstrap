                            <p>I'm Elisabeth Mayr, a freelance UX/UI web and mobile designer. Let's work together</p>
                        </div>

                            goals, you can start with weekly, bi-weekly or monthly sessions. If you’re unsure, you can
                            also <a href="https://calendly.com/elisabethmayr/">[book a chemistry call]</a> to see if
                            it’s something you can commit to regularly. Whatever

                <div class="page_title text-center freelance_coaching_box">
                    <h3>Understanding your freelance business</h3>
                    <p>As an experienced freelancer, I know that getting caught up in too much client work will make it
                        easy to lose sight of the overall goal of the business. </p>
                    <p>A freelance coach will get a birds-eye view of your business and find areas to improve and
                        automate, so you can concentrate on what you do best: Deliver great work and help your clients
                        achieve their goals. It’s about stepping back before stepping up. As your business coach, I will
                        help you evaluate what works and what doesn’t. From there, you’ll see what actions to take to
                        make your goals attainable. </p>
                    <p>Doing this allows you to see all the moving parts of your business. You’ll learn how to take
                        control of your freelance career, enabling you to make any changes along the way to grow your
                        understanding of how everything works - from the ground up. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="page_title text-center freelance_coaching_box">
                    <h3>Generating a plan</h3>
                    <p>Once you understand where you want to be, it’s time to start creating a plan. Coaching calls will
                        provide simple but effective ways to make a business plan that will help achieve your goals in a
                        realistic timeframe. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="page_title text-center freelance_coaching_box">
                    <h3>Improving confidence</h3>
                    <p>Established freelancers will know that finding your confidence when things aren’t going as well
                        as you’d hoped can be challenging. </p>
                    <p>Regular coaching will help you maintain and manage your motivation and inner strength through any
                        situation, the good and the bad.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="page_title text-center freelance_coaching_box">
                    <h3>Marketing yourself</h3>
                    <p>As a freelancer, you are the be-all and end-all of the business. You need to know how to market
                        yourself and your work in a way that makes clients want to work with you. </p>
                    <p>You can learn how to market yourself effectively to reach your main audience and attract your
                        dream clients. Learn what works, what doesn’t and how you can implement marketing strategies to
                        get your business thriving. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="page_title text-center freelance_coaching_box">
                    <h3>Effective communication</h3>
                    <p>All freelancers need to know how to communicate with clients to understand their needs
                        effectively. You also need to know how to negotiate timeframes and costs.</p>
                    <p>In the coaching sessions I will help you understand these lines of communication and how to
                        navigate them better as a freelancer. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="page_title text-center freelance_coaching_box">
                    <h3>Overcoming procrastination</h3>
                    <p>Every freelancer, no matter where they are in their career, has struggled with procrastination.
                        The reason is often caused by the uncomfort that comes with a task and the underlying fear of
                        not being good enough. Add a sprinkle of imposter syndrome and you have a cherry on top. </p>
                    <p>Coaching can help you get into the right mindset to stop procrastinating and start getting things
                        done. You’ll learn to take on bite-sized chunks that are attainable within the timeframe. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="page_title text-center freelance_coaching_box">
                    <h3>Setting boundaries </h3>
                    <p>Many freelancers put in a lot more hours than the average 9-5. But you don’t have to. If you
                        manage your time well and set boundaries, you’ll be able to create a work-life balance that
                        works for you. It’s common in self-employment to work longer hours to achieve success but it's
                        all down to how you manage your business and your freelance career. There will be phases where
                        you might end up working more, but you don’t have to make this your default state.</p>
                    <p>However, it becomes an issue when the lines between personal and professional time blur. Coaching
                        sessions can show you how to establish boundaries and stick to them—giving you the time you need
                        for yourself while also reaching your professional goals.</p>
