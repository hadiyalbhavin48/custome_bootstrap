                <p>But what if I told you that once you get the ball rolling, you won't have to spend so much time finding them. Instead, they'll come to you. All you need to do is let them know your availability.</p>

Someone in your network will know someone who is looking for someone with the skills that you offer! And there are so many platforms for freelancers where people will find you, instead of you having to chase clients. And I will show you where.</p>

              <li>✅ A network to reach out to when you're looking for jobs, so you can line up the next gig when your contract ends.</li>
              <li>✅ The knowledge you need to be able to deal with all types of clients, from laissez-fair clients to micromanagers. So you can spot them and only work with clients you love.</li>
              <li>✅ A way of tracking and managing your work, so you exceed your clients' expectations while keeping track of invoices and admin stuff.</li>
              <li>✅ All the things you need to consider regarding tax and setting up a company (UK only), so you can concentrate on your business.</li>

      <h3>Why invest in a freelance programme when you can google it all?</h3>
      <p>Yes, you can do it all by yourself (that's how I did it). But it wasn't easy.</p>
      <p>I want to save you the hassle I went through — all that time I spent scrolling on Google and the mistakes I made along the way.</p>

      <h4>Let me put things in perspective</h4>
      <p>In my last perm job I earned <b>£37,500</b> as Head of Design in a start up in London. That was in 2019.</p>
      <p>My initial day rate as a freelance UX Designer was £350, <b>which meant that I made the same money in less than 6 months.</b> 🤯🤯🤯</p>
      <p>It's entirely possible to earn back your investment in this group programme within your first week of freelancing.</p>

        <h2>Why work with me?</h2>
        <p>I've been freelancing for about 3 years and I've figured it all out the hard way. Trust me, freelancing isn't always easy. But it can be.</p>
        <h5>Don't do it the hard way</h5>
        <p>Most people ask me where I find clients, but I struggled saying no to them at the beginning. There was a time in my career where I juggled 6 clients in one week and it was exhausting — please don't make that mistake.</p>
        <p>Freelancing has opened opportunities for me that I never thought I'd have. I've worked with amazing people and learnt so much from different types of projects and teams, all while travelling and working remotely, and earning more than I thought I ever would.</p>
        <h5>Take the shortcut</h5>
        <p>I've made all the mistakes a freelancer can possibly make, and I still love it. I want you to know that you can live the life you want by being your own boss and I want to help you get there.</p>
       <p>This course will help you get there faster. You will get direct access to me to answer all of your questions.</p>
       <h5>Why now?</h5>
       <p>The better question is 'Why wait?' We only have one life and it shouldn't be to spent working for someone else's pockets to get bigger. There is more to life than work.</p>
