      <h3>What you'll learn</h3>
      <p>In this course, you'll learn everything you need to know about money as a freelancer and how to best manage your business finances. The first modules will teach you what to do with the money you’re earning. The second part will teach you how to earn more. But before you earn more, make sure you know what to do with your income, how much to save it, where, and what to put aside for the tax man.
        </p>

        <p>We’re all very busy, and unless accounting or giving financial advice is your core freelance service, you shouldn’t spend hours and hours on doing research or watching courses that won’t teach you what you need.</p>
        <p>
          You’ll get <b>forever-access to the course and its updates</b> so you’ll always know the bare minimum to be a successful freelancer.

                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>I’m not a financial adviser, but I’ve been a freelancer for 4+ years and learned many things the hard way. I lost out on money, I didn’t increase my rates, I picked the wrong VAT method for my business and therefor lost out on money. But don’t worry, I’ve done all of that so you don’t have to. </p>
                <p>This course is here to help you make financial decisions as a freelancer. Please talk to a financial adviser when you’re making <b>BIG</b> decisions. Also, I highly recommend hiring an accountant once you start your freelance career. But it’ll be very beneficial if you know about money, so you can ask the right questions. Nobody will care as much about your income and increasing your savings as you do. So the more you know, the higher are your chances of making the most of your money.

              <h2>About your instructor</h2>
              <p>I’m a freelance UX Designer based in London, originally from Austria but I’ve worked as an employee in the UK for a handful of years before starting to go freelance.</p><p>As a freelancer, I’ve worked as a sole-trader, within an umbrella company and now under a limited company. Therefore, the advice is very much tailored to freelancers based in the UK. However, there’ll be information that is relevant to you, no matter what tax residency you hold.</p>

        <h2>Why work with me?</h2>
        <p>I've been freelancing for about 4 years and I've figured it all out the hard way. Trust me, freelancing isn't always easy. But it can be.</p>
        <h5>Don't do it the hard way</h5>
        <p>I've done it the hard way, it's not always fun. I'll show you everything you need to know so you don't waste valuable time for your business.</p>
        <h5>Take the shortcut</h5>
        <p>I've made almost all the mistakes a freelancer could possibly make, and I still love it. I want you to know that you can live the life you want by being your own boss and I want to help you get there.</p>
