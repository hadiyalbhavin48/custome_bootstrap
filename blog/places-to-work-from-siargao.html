            <h3>Why Siargao?</h3>
            <p> After having been a digital nomad for over a year, I started to pick my travel destinations based on surfing opportunities. So I asked a few people I met while surfing which places they recommend and one place got a lot of mentions: Siargao.</p>
              <p>Siargao is one of the 7100+ islands in the Philippines with great surfing spots, but unfortunately, since it's a bit of a remote island, the wifi isn't as great.</p>

            <h5>Is there reliable wifi in Siargao?</h5>
              <p>One of my worries before going there was about how good the wifi will be in Siargao. It's quite touristy but at the same time, it's a remote island. So I only booked for 3 weeks, just in case the wifi quality was bad. And to no surprise, it was.</p>
              <p>Thanks to regular blackouts - and there were a lot, especially during holy week while many people travelled to the island and increased demand in electricity - it was quite tricky to find stable wifi.</p>

            <p>This place was recommended to me first by a Japanese barista and competitive surfer who stayed in the same accommodation as me. Since he's a barista, I trusted his recommendation. I initially went there for the coffee but saw a few people working on their laptops.</p>
            <p>So I went there again the next day to try it out and it was a good place to work from. Even though there is no air condition, the temperature is bearable because of the open space design.</p>

            <p>I loved working from Lamari. Going through the entrance, past the tropical plants and past the little gold fish puts you in a good mood before you even arrive on your "desk". The design of the building is very pleasing to the eye and because of the space and how things are set up, there is always a gentle and welcomed breeze. And no, it's not like a draft, it's actually pleasant in this heat.</p>
            <p>Unlike many other places in Siargao, you can pay by card without the 3% extra charge. The only other place where that was possible was Las Palmas (more about Las Palmas below).</p>

            <p>This was one of the first places I worked from and the staff is very friendly. On my second visit I was already greeted by name and felt like a VIP, which was a bit uncomfortable but nice at the same time.</p>
            <p>There's also a small pool if you want to cool down. Depending on the time of day it can get busy sometimes, but so far, we've always gotten a spot when we visited.</p>
            <p>There are a few plugs but only at the bar. So if you run out of juice quickly, make sure to grab a spot there.</p>
            <p>If you're ending up grabbing your lunch there as well, I highly recommend ordering the burger.</p>

            <p>This was one of the main places I worked from, mainly because the food is so amazing here! They also serve items from the Spotted Pig (see below) so you can get Spotted Pig coffee but I recommend ordering food from the Las Palmas kitchen, it won't disappoint!</p>
            <p>Their breakfast, lunch and dinner menus vary and there's a lot of great options. My favourite were the rice bowls for lunch. The pumpkin soup was surprisingly tasty. Their desserts look great but don't taste that amazing though.</p>

            <p>When I did my research on places to work from in Siargao, this place was mentioned in every single blog, so I gave it a visit.</p>

                <p>The next day, I still wanted to check out the Spotted Pig, so I arrived early, got a table and started work. It almost has a library feel because 90% of the people there are working. Just as in Las Palmas, you get a voucher code to access the wifi for a limited time.</p>
                <p>The place is air conditioned, so it's comfortable to work from. Their coffee choices are decent and people are very much in the work zone.</p>
                <p>Even though it gets annoying when the wifi stops after 2 hours, I felt very focused there. Probably because it was the one place where the majority of people were working instead of eating or drinking.</p>

            <p>Greenhouse became one of our go to spots. Unlike the Spotted Pig or Las Palmas, the wifi doesn't have a time-cap, so you can surf online as long as you like - or until the next power cut.</p>
            <p>I don't usually like working right next to the beach. The sun just gets too strong and the glare is too much and I realise I frown the whole time trying to figure out what's on my screen. But here, the garden is quite a big size, so the sun doesn't reflect  on you too much.</p>

            <p>It can get quite hot during the day, as there's no air condition and even though it's an outside space, it's not as airy, so you're eager for a breeze.</p>
            <p>If, like me, you have many calls around 5pm Filipino time but you want to see the sunset (even though you won't be able to see the sun itself, as it's going down on the other end of the island) this is the spot to be.</p>
            <p>There are 2 Green House restaurants right next to one another. So if you arrive and wonder where the beach view is: you're at the wrong one.</p>
            <p>Definitely try the Calamansi juice, it's very refreshing. And the food options are good too, especially the banana fritters.</p>

            <p>They also had wifi, and even though I don't usually like working from the beach directly (as I mentioned before) I quite enjoyed working from here.</p>
            <p>It can get quite busy in the morning when people come for breakfast, so if you're like me and get a bit conscious when you feel like you're occupying a table with just your laptop while people are waiting, there's one "lonely" high table in the corner facing the ocean where you cannot really place more than one person. So I didn't feel too guilty occupying that spot.</p>
            <p>Their coffee was alright but their smoothie bowls are better. I didn't work there for long as it got quite hot but definitely worth to check out for brunch too.</p>

            <h2>Other mentions</h2>
            <p>Here's a few places that I've not managed to check out in my time in Siargao but are on my list to visit.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5WAVT8eVdBovPcvr7" target="_blank">Goodies</a></h4>
            <p>This one is next to Green house. I saw it on Google maps while browsing for places and it had great reviews. Definitely want to try it next time I'm in Siargao. If you've been there or happen to go, let me know if it's worth a visit.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QLYb2vHYPCFW9Ck26" target="_blank">Bake</a></h4>
            <p>This one wasn't actually recommended to me in person but popped up in every single blog post I found about places to work from in Siargao. Unfortunately, it was closed every time I drove past.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rJHyMZMqyW4BRRi97" target="_blank">White Beard</a></h4>
            <p>This one was recommended to me by several people but it was quite far away from where I stayed. My accommodation was around Cloud 9 and this place is quite in the center of General Luna. I heard it gets very busy for brunch time because the food is amazing. Not sure if you can work from there as well.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7UfWL17geVpgpUCc8" target="_blank">Ocean 101</a></h4>
            <p>I've only been here briefly and didn't end up using my laptop because I got caught up in a conversation with a friend. But supposedly the wifi here is good. It's actually a resort. I met a guy who stayed there who said the wifi from the rooms is great too.</p>

              <h3>Is it worth visiting Siargao as a Digital Nomad?</h3>
              <p>Personally, I think it definitely is. But set your expectations about the wifi: If you have any important meetings, then maybe this is not the place for you. If you can work a lot in your own time, it's definitely manageble.</p>
              <p>But also, I heard that Starlink just started providing internet when I was leaving. So there's hope for more stable wifi in the future.</p>
