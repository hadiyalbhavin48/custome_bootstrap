                <h2>About <span itemprop="about">Greggs</span></h2>
                <p>If you're from the UK, then Greggs probably won't need an introduction. If you've stumbled upon my portfolio from elsewhere: Greggs has been serving the UK with baked goods since xxxx. They're famous for their sausage rolls, especially their vegan version.
                </p>

				  <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>Greggs has hired me as a freelancer to help them improve parts of the app (link to case study in future) and most importantly, their gifting journey. Before, a third party provider has dealt with the gift card purchases for them. They wanted to move the journey in-house and host it on their platform. And while they had to code the journey from scratch, they decided to also work on the UX of their gifting journey.</p>
				  <p>You can find Greggs' current gifting journey on <a href="https://greggs.co.uk/gifting" target="_blank">greggs.co.uk/gifting</a>.</p>
         	
          <h4>The Team</h4>
          <p>The team consisted of a Product Manager and their assistant, several developers and me. </p>

          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>Greggs problem was that the current gifting journey didn't produce many sales. The design problem was that Greggs' design system for their website was in Adobe XD and I had to transition them into Figma. Some items were already moved to Figma but didn't keep the link to the main component. </p>
          
         <h3>The Goal</h3>
				  <p>Greggs wanted to improve the gift card purchase experience for their users, reduce drop-offs and increase sales. They also wanted to move their design assets from Adobe XD to Figma.</p>

              <h2>The Design Process</h2>
              <h3>Reviewing the existing journey</h3>
              <p>I had a look at the current gift card journey and at the steps required to purchase a gift card. The user had to choose a design and a value. They also had the option to either order a 
                tangible gift card, send the gift as an email or as a text message, which all required different information to provide by the user.</p>
             </div>

             <div class="column-12">
          
              <div class="column-8 offset-2 image"><img alt="Greggs gift Card Options" src="../assets/images/work/uxdesign/greggs/xx.png"/>
             
                <p class="caption">Gift Card options</p>
                <br>
              </div>
              </div>


             <div class="column-6">		
              <h4>Quick fixes</h4>
              <p>There were a few areas of the previous journey which weren't the best for a user and could easily be improved. One of those being a slider for the gift card value. Entering an exact value will be easier than having to use a slider which would lead to uneven gift card values. (Was it a stepper slider), which , ie reducing the non required fields.
              </p>
              <p>I looked into how those steps can be grouped and what would make the most sense for the user. For example, I didn't want to ask for address information, if the gift card was an email gift card. Or ask for an email, if it was going to be a SMS gift card, to ensure the user only types in what was needed.</p>
              <p>Since Greggs had more mobile than desktop users, the journey was tackled with a mobile first approach. I wanted to create simple steps where the user could just tap and go to the next step. My goal was to make it a smooth and easy journey, similar to type form forms.

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
				  
				  <p>One of the things that differentiated Greggs' gift card journey from others was the High Roller card. If the user purchased a gift card of £50 or more, they were able to select a certain gift card design. If they then were to reduce the value to below £50, that design would no longer be available.
          </p>
          <p>I wanted to reduce the disappointment for the user, incase they were to select the high roller card design but couldn't continue purchasing it because they haven't selected a +£50 value. But on the other hand, if they did select a high enough value, I wanted them to feel rewarded, as if they discovered something bespoke for them.</p>

				<p class="caption">High Roller Gift Card</p></div>
        <div class="column-6">	
          <h4>Easter Egg</h4>
          <p>I decided to hide the high roller card design to avoid disappointment and instead, reward users who chose a high gift card value.</p>
          <p>Selecting the £50 value will bring up the new design option with a confetti, so that the user will see it appear, even if their focus was at a different part of the screen. This way, a bit of gamification was added to the discovery and potential disappointment of seeing a card design that wasn't available to the user was removed.</p>

				  <h2>User journeys and flows</h2>
         
				  <p>I wanted to ensure that there was a smooth flow across the different screens. With every user journey that involves the user to put in their card details, the journey has to be easy and feel trustworthy. If anything felt like a bug or not safe, it could hold the user back from providing their card details.</p>
				  <p>Another thing to note was that different gift card types (tangible card, email or SMS) required different fields. I didn't want the user to add information that wasn't required, so I removed the non required fields for each of those sub journeys.</p><br>

				<h2>Wireframes</h2>
				  <p>Once I've grouped the steps and required and non-required fields, I put them together in a wireframe stage. I create a simple prototype to showcase how the user would navigate through the different pages.

          <h3>Font styles</h3>
          <p>Pentagram also provided a bespoke font for Impala. There was a good documentation for print, however, there were no exact guidelines for digital use. Based on the cleaned up wireframes, I worked on guidelines using the new font styles to be used across the website. To ensure consistency across all of Impala's digital products, I discussed the font styles with the design team at Impala, who was also working on making the fonts work for their ditigtal products. The fonts below made it to the final design library for the website.</p>

          <h3>MVP Soft-launch</h3>
            <p>Impala had a tight deadline for their brand release. Due to the time needed for development, we decided to have an MVP website with the most important modules and information.</p>
            <p>After the MVP launch, I continued testing the new modules before they were released at a later stage. The remaining modules included additional heroes, more explainer modules as well as a new blog page design.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>After the initial UI design was done, I conducted some qualitative user research. Usually, I prefer testing at wireframe stage. Since it was difficult to 
        source users, as it's a B2B project, and the branding was playing an important part, I decided to test in the UI stage rather than the wireframe stage.</p>
       <p>During the user testing sessions it became clear that some modules were more relevant than others. Users were more interested in which hotels or room sellers
          they could access as well as how Impala compared to other solutions, so the relevant modules were moved further up the page.</p>
          <p>User testing sessions were done remotely, following a script I prepared. I recorded the sessions and took notes in notion.</p>

        <h2>Blog Design</h2>
          <p>The blog had to be migrated from the previous to the new CMS. To make this as quick and easy as possible, a basic blog design had to be developed, due to the restrictions of the migration. The developers provided a version with modules that they needed redesigned. Below you can find the modules requested by the developers and the designs provided.</p>
